  </div>

  <div id="about">
    <p>Papua New Guinea officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is a
      country in Oceania that comprises the eastern half of the island in New Guinea and its offshore
      islands in Melanesia. Its capital is located along its southeastern coast, Port Moresby.</p>

      <br>

      <p>What is Papua New Guinea known for? It is known for being abundant in its resources but it is 
        a country where modern necessities such as electricity aren’t available to all people. Be that 
        as it may, it still has nice people.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Papua New Guinea is one of the world's least studied countries, both
        culturally and physically, due to its remote location and isolation. This means that its cultural life
        and customs have been allowed to flourish for millennia without being corrupted by foreign
        influences. And, with an estimated 750 tribes residing here, it has more than simply
        well-preserved culture; it has a wonderful richness of it, with hundreds of varied tribal traditions
        and rites that are both very local and completely unique.</p>

    <h1 id="title2"><u>HISTORY</u></h1>
  </div>

  <div id="history">
    <p>Papua New Guinea’s ancient inhabitants are believed to arrive there about 50-60 thousand years ago 
      during an Ice Age period in Southeast Asia. The sea was lower and distances between islands were shorter. 
      It used to be known as New Guinea. It was one of the first land masses after Africa and Eurasia which 
      was to be populated by modern humans, its first migration took place about the same time as Australia, 
      putting it alongside one of the world's oldest continuous cultures.</p>

      <br>

      <p>Agriculture in New Guinea was independently developed the highlands around 7,000 BC. 
        It is one of the world's few original plant domestication zones. Headhunting and cannibalism were 
        once common in many sections of what is now known as Papua New Guinea. By the early 1950s, 
        open cannibalism had all but vanished due to administrative and missionary efforts.</p>

        </div>

      <br>

      <p>In the early 16th century, a group of Portuguese and Spanish navigators cruising in the 
        South Pacific were likely the first Europeans to see Papua New Guinea. Don Jorge de Meneses, 
        a Portuguese adventurer, is credited with discovering Papua New Guinea's main island in 
        roughly 1526-1527.</p>

        </div>

      <br>

      <p>In 1884, German New Guinea was formed from the northern part of Papua New Guinea. 
        Godeffroy's of Hamburg, the Pacific's largest trading concern, began dealing for copra in the 
        New Guinea Islands in response to Europe's expanding demand for coconut oil. In 1884, Germany 
        formally assumed control of the island's northeast part and entrusted its administration to a 
        chartered company. The German imperial government took direct control of the territory in 1899, 
        and it became known as German New Guinea after that. German New Guinea was captured by Australian 
        forces in 1914, and it remained under Australian military rule until 1921.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1920, the British Government assumed a mandate from the League of Nations to manage the 
        Territory of New Guinea on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Australian government
        was in charge of the mandate until it was suspended in December 1941 due to the Japanese invasion. 
        Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, civil government in Papua and New Guinea was restored, 
        and the Papua New Guinea Provisional Administration Act, 1945-46, merged Papua and New Guinea
        into an administrative union to form Papua New Guinea.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Following elections in 1972, a government was formed, led by Chief Minister Michael Somare, 
        who promised to lead the country to self-governance and subsequently independence. 
        Papua New Guinea gained independence on September 16, 1975, after becoming self-governing on 
        December 1, 1973. On 10 October 1975, the country became a member of the United Nations &lpar;UN&rpar; as a 
        result of Security Council Resolution 375 and General Assembly Resolution 3368</p>

      <br>

      <p>Here are some fun facts in the History of Paupa New Guinea:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Headhunting and cannibalism were formerly common in many sections of Papua New Guinea. 
          By the early 1950s, open cannibalism had all but vanished due to administrative and missionary efforts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Around the year 1526-1527, a Portuguese explorer named Don Jorge de Meneses was credited to have 
          discovered the islands of Papua New Guinea. Despite the fact that European navigators continued to come and 
          study the New Guinea islands for the following 170 years, the inhabitants largely kept to themselves until the 
          late nineteenth century.
        </li>
        <li>
          Papua New Guinea used to be two different countries that were influenced and colonized over a 
          period of 250 years. In 1885, Germany seized New Guinea's northern coast while Britain annexed 
          Papua's southern parts. In 1906, the British handed the Papua Territory to Australia, then Australia
          attacked German New Guinea in World War I and took possession under a League of Nations mandate. 
          In 1945, Australia gained sovereignty of both areas under a UN Trusteeship Agreement. 
          They merged in 1949 to become Papua New Guinea, which gained independence in 1975.

    <h1 id="title3"><u>CULTURE</u></h1>
  </div>

  <div id="culture">
    <p>Despite the fact that most of Papua New Guinea remains undiscovered and
      unexplained, it is feasible to meet and learn about some of the tribes on New Guinea and the
      adjacent islands. The Highlands are an excellent location for tribal encounters and are home to
      some of PNG's most resilient cultures. You can take part in a traditional mumu feast, where food
      is wrapped in banana leaves and grilled over hot stones, or watch a sing song, a performance
      created to allow neighboring villages to peacefully exchange their customs.</p>

      <br>

      <p><strong>Highlights of Papua New Guinea Culture</strong></p>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Asaro "Mudmen"</strong>
          <br>
          The men of the Asaro tribe are known as 'Mudmen,' because they cover themselves
          in mud and wear ghastly clay masks studded with pigs' teeth and shells. The mud and
          mask combination made the men look like spirits or ghosts, which terrified their enemies
          and gave the Asaro a fearsome advantage. There are various origin myths surrounding this
          tradition, but they all center on the mud and mask combination making the men look like
          spirits or ghosts, which terrified their enemies and gave the Asaro a fearsome advantage.
          The Asaro people started the mud mask practice, but numerous tribes in the Eastern
          Highlands have recently copied it for commercial gain.

        <li><strong>Goroka Show</strong>
          <br>
          In September, Goroka, the capital of the Eastern Highlands Province, hosts the
          longest-running tribal gathering and cultural event in Papua New Guinea. It's an
          annual event started in the 1950s by Australian patrol officers with the goal of
          bringing isolated and traditionally feuding tribes together in a peaceful setting.
          More than a hundred tribes are now taking part, putting on shows of sing sings –
          traditional songs, dances, and ritual performances – and donning amazing and
          colorful ethnic garb.

        <li><strong>Warwagira & National Mask Festival</strong>
          <br>
          This yearly festival, which began in 1995 and is celebrated in July, honors the Tolai,
          Baining, and Sulka people of East New Britain Province by celebrating their unique
          mask traditions. It's a cultural spectacular in Kokopo that includes cultural
          dancing, ritual performance, and storytelling, as well as a range of arts and crafts.
          The Kinavai is the opening ritual, which features the Tolai Tubuans and Duk-Duks
          &lpar;masked spirits&rpar; rising from the sea mist at dawn. The customary Tolai shell money
          trades that herald the festival's start may also be seen.

        <li><strong>Baining Fire Dance</strong>
          <br>
          The Fire Dance is a rite of passage performed by adolescent male
          members of the Baining tribe of New Britain. They compete wearing massive headdresses,
          shaped like animals’ heads, and run through and kick the fire, sending up showers of sparks,
          accompanied by chanting and singing from village elders.

  <div id="food">
    <p>The cuisine of Papua New Guinea are the traditional varied foods found in the
       eastern part of the New Guinea island. Approximately 80% of the population is reliant on
       subsistence agriculture, so a large percentage of food energy and protein consumed in Papua
       New Guinea is produced locally, while the balance is imported. The staple foods in Papua New
       Guinea include root crops, bananas, and sago. Papua New Guinea's diet is largely vegetarian,
       especially in the Gulf and Highlands regions.</p>

      <li><strong>Mumu</strong>
        <br>
        Mumu is a traditional Papua New Guinean cooking method, and it’s an interesting way to cook 
        food! A typical Mumu is a ground oven/pit filled with flaming hot coals and banana leaves. 
        Meat, carbohydrates, vegetables, and fruits are placed last at the bottom of the pile. 
        To ensure that the dish steams correctly, the whole thing is wrapped in a banana leaf. 
        It is buried for hours in order to cook.

      Most of the
      population of more than 8,000,000 people live in customary communities, which are as diverse
      as the languages.</p>

    <h3>Culture</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Papua New Guinea is one of the world's least studied countries, both culturally and physically, due to its remote location and isolation. This means that its cultural life and customs have been allowed to flourish for millennia without being corrupted by foreign influences. And, with an estimated 750 tribes residing here, it has more than simply well-preserved culture; it has a wonderful richness of it, with hundreds of varied tribal traditions and rites that are both very local and completely unique</p>

   </div>
   <ol>
     <li><strong>Did you know?</strong>
      <br>
      Papua New Guinea can be traced back to as early 
      as 50,000-60,000 years ago, when people from Southeast Asia first migrated to the 
      Australian Continent! They were believed to have migrated during and Ice Age period 
      where sea levels were lower and there was little distance between islands.</li>

      <br>
      <li>The flag of Papua New Guinea is made up of two diagonally arranged triangles. 
        The left side of the triangle is black, while the right triangle is red. 
      <br>
        A five-pointed five-white star represents the Southern Cross star cluster on the black 
        triangle, and a yellow bird of paradise symbol is on the red triangle. 
      <br>
        The traditional colors of Papua New Guinean art and clothing are black, red, and yellow. 
      <br>
        The yellow bird of paradise is a cultural icon in Papua New Guinea. The image of a bird 
        flying with its wings spread represents freedom and the birth of the country as an 
        independent nation. 
      <br>
        5 stars represent Epsilon stars, which are not as bright as the 
        Southern Cross, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and other constellations. 
      <br>
        The Southern Cross, 
        as in the Australian flag, represents the country's geographical position in the world 
        and its commitment to that country.</li> 

      <br> 
        <li>Papua New Guinea is home to tree kangaroos
          Since 1990, Papua New Guinea has been home to the tree kangaroo. 
          It is a golden-mantled tree kangaroo, which locals found in the Torricelli Mountains. 
          Many scientists suggest that the golden-mantled tree kangaroo is extirpated from 99% 
          of its historical range but the numbers are low due to hunting and destruction.</li>

        <br>
        <li>Papua New Guinea used to be part of a prehistoric subcontinent called Sahul
          Only 10,000 years ago – due to rising sea levels – Papua New Guinea and Australia separated from each other. 
          
          The prehistoric continent was Sahul, and it comprised Tasmania, Australia, 
          and Papua New Guinea. Sahuls separation led to the Australian aboriginals becoming 
          genetically isolated and the world’s oldest civilisation.</li>
